TestList.java and TestIterator.java

	TODO also try with a LinkedList - does it make any difference?

		When I swapped to a LinkedList, all of the tests still pass, so assuming that the tests cover the possible
		 scenarios well, it does not seem to make a difference.

TestList.java

	testRemoveObject()

		list.remove(5); // what does this method do?

			This removes the item at list index 5.

		list.remove(Integer.valueOf(5)); // what does this one do?

			This removes the first occurrence of 5 in the list.

TestIterator.java

	testRemove()

		i.remove(); // what happens if you use list.remove(77)?

			Since list.remove(Integer.valueOf(77)) only removes the first occurrence of 77,
			there will still be other 2 more occurrences left, whereas the original implementation
			removes all 3 occurrences.

TestPerformance.java

	State how many times the tests were executed for each SIZE (10, 100, 1000 and 10000)
	to get the running time in milliseconds and how the test running times were recorded.

	SIZE 10
								  #1   #2   #3   #4   #5   #6 	... (as many tests as you ran)
        testArrayListAddRemove:  val1 val2 val3 val4 val5 val6  ... (fill these in in ms)
        testLinkedListAddRemove: val1 val2 val3 val4 val5 val6
		testArrayListAccess:     val1 val2 val3 val4 val5 val6
        testLinkedListAccess:    val1 val2 val3 val4 val5 val6

	SIZE 100
								  #1   #2   #3   #4   #5   #6 	... (as many tests as you ran)
        testArrayListAddRemove:  val1 val2 val3 val4 val5 val6  ... (fill these in in ms)
        testLinkedListAddRemove: val1 val2 val3 val4 val5 val6
